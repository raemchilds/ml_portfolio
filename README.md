# ml_portfolio

🧵 Machine Learning projects from an Etsy-purchased guide. Hands-on practice with Python, real datasets, and classic algorithms—from Titanic survival to customer segmentation.

## 🧠 Etsy ML Projects Collection

This repository contains machine learning projects from the Etsy-purchased guide  
**"Master Machine Learning with 50 Python Projects for Beginners and Experts"** by Moonlight Pixel.

These projects cover a wide range of ML techniques—from regression to classification and clustering—using real-world datasets and Python libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
