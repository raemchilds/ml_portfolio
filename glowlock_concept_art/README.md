# 🌱 Glowlock Labs – AI Concept Art Generator

This notebook generates storybook-style fantasy concept art for an original world called **Glowlock**, a whimsical and narrative-rich universe with hand-illustrated realms like:

- **Moss Merry Way** – a glowing, mossy forest
- **Dusk Hallows** – a haunted castle that breathes
- **Jingle Hoof** – a vanilla-snowy Christmas village
- **Pearl Mist** – an underwater mermaid lagoon


*Note: If the notebook doesn’t render on GitHub, open it directly in Google Colab or download and open in Jupyter.*

Built with:
- 🤗 `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` (Hugging Face Diffusers)
- 🚀 GPU acceleration in Google Colab
- 🔐 Secure token-based access to Hugging Face models

> Created by Rachael Childs as part of **Glowlock Labs**, an experimental studio exploring emotionally intelligent AI, creative tech, and storytelling interfaces.
